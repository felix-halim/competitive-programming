<h1>Day 1, Take off to Bangalore, India (25 Mar 2005)</h1>
<p>At 9:30 AM, I was heading to the Soekarno-Hatta airport and meet with my friends from Universitas Parahyangan, Bandung: Pascal Alfadian Nugroho and Renald.</p>

<p>There wasn't any difficulties going to Singapore. During the transit, we met the other Indonesian friends: Ardian KP, Bramandia R, and Prima C. Also we met other contestants that appeared to be on the same flight.</p>

<tr><td align=center>Singapore Airlines... each seats has a monitor and a "controller".<br>
When you flip the controller, it could be used as a phone.<br>
It can call to any seats on the plane or call outside plane using card.</table>

<p>We then arrive at Bangalore International Airport after 4 hours flying.</p>

<p>There are 10 contestants in the plane. We assembled at the outside of the Bangalore International Airport waiting to be picked up by the agent.</p>

<p>After phoning Mr. Tapas approximately 10 minutes we were escorted to the Park Hotel. The hotel is near the airport only 15 minutes distance by car.</p>

<tr><td align=center>We were checking in to the Park Hotel</table>


<p>I was assigned to room 104. Google is generous... each person was assigned to a double room (two persons). In the hotel, there was so many mirrors. I really loved it, I could take a picture of my self easily. Here you will find many picture of me reflected by the mirrors.</p>

<p>After putting our stuffs in our room and rest a bit, we were heading to the "Blue Box Room" (still in the Park Hotel) to get our Google T-Shirt. In fact we got not only Google T-Shirt but also Google Bag! (the inside of the bag was two Google Pen, a Google Bottle, and a Google Hat!). That's very nice gifts from Google India :)</p>

<p>Ok that's for the first day: register to Park Hotel and get the Google Stuffs.</p>
