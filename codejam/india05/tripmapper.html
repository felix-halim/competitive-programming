<h1>Trip Mapper</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>Many trip planning programs exist, and are set up to give you the shortest driving distance between two locations. However, frequently the directions involve taking several quick turns on small side roads, and this can be very confusing. Often times, someone who knows the area well will be able to suggest another route that, although perhaps slightly longer, involves a much simpler set of directions. For the purposes of this problem, we define the simplest set of directions as being the set of directions involving the fewest turns.</p>
<p>In a certain city, all of the roads have all corners and end points defined at a lattice point (one with integer coordinates), and all roads travel exactly east-west or north-south.</p>
<p>You are given Strings start and end representing the coordinates of the starting point and ending point of the trip. You are also given a String[], roads, which defines all of the roads in a city. Each element of roads is formatted as "x1 y1 x2 y2" indicating a road from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). You may assume that there is an intersection wherever two roads cross each other. (E.g. you can always turn from one road to the other at such a point, there are no bridges or tunnels).</p>
<p>The directions from the start to end point should start with the direction of travel, 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W', and number of block to travel. Turns should be indicated by the letter 'R' or 'L' (right or left) and the number of blocks to travel. Thus, "N3R4" would mean go north three blocks, turn right and go four more blocks. "N2R2R2R2" would lead you right back to the starting point.</p>
<p>You are to return a String representing the simplest set of directions (the one with the fewest turns) from the start point to the end point. If there is a tie, return the one that comes first alphanumerically (for example, "N10R5L4" is preferred over "N7R5L7" since they both involve 2 turns, but the former comes first alphanumerically). If it is impossible to get from the origin to the destination on the roads as described, you should return an empty string ("").</p>

<h2>Definition</h2>
Class: TripMapper<br>
Method: simplestDirections<br>
Parameters: String, String, String[]<br>
Returns: String<br>
Method signature: String simplestDirections(String start, String end, String[] roads)<br>
(be sure your method is public)<br>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>North is the +y direction, while east is the +x direction.
<li>When comparing strings alphanumerically, order them by the ASCII value of the first character for which the two strings differ (numbers come before letters).
<li>Your return should not have any extra leading zeros in the numbers.
</ul>

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each number in the inputs will an integer between 0 and 500, inclusive, and will not contain any extra leading zeros.
<li>start and end will be formatted as two numbers separated by a single space.
<li>start and end will not be the same.
<li>roads will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<li>Each element of roads will be formatted as 4 numbers separated by single spaces.
<li>Each road will be directly north-south or east-west.
<li>No two roads will overlap (though they may touch at a single point).
<li>Each road will have length of at least one (the roads will not be points).
</ul>

"10 10"
"20 10"
{"10 10 10 19", "10 19 20 19", "20 19 20 10", "10 10 11 10",
 "11 10 11 9", "11 9 19 9", "19 9 19 10", "19 10 20 10"}
Returns: "N9R10R9"
</pre>

<p>Here, there are two different ways to get from the start point to the end point. Although the northern route is much longer (28 units), it requires only two turns. The shorter, southern route takes four turns.
We start out going north 9 units, turn right, go 10 units, and then turn right again, and go 9 units to reach our destination. The directions for the "easiest" route are thus "N9R10R9".</p>
