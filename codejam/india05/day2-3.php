<tr><td align=center>In this Googleplex, we have a lunch</table>

<p>Shortly after lunch, google then start talking (Google Tech Talk). Here Google explains why helding this competition event (you can guess, to recruit more people). They explains about Google Technology (I really impressed when they talk about the Distributed Computing, that is separating the jobs when doing a <b>search</b>). A single search of google, actually involving thousands of computer of cluster. This is very interesting! I wish I had a video camera...</p>

<p>"Most people avoid problems... but we, programmers, like to solve problems :)" Google Presenter (what's his name?)</p>

<p>The presenter said something about Google motto. When Google develop something, they don't think: "Where is the Money?". When they know what they're developing makes the user happy, they know there's money in it :) Coolll! I think this is statement is quite true as I see many google software really2 easy to use and useful but I don't see how it relates to money... (they really2 focus on users need).</p>
