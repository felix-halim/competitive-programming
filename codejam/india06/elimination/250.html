<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>Let's call a rectangular matrix monotonous if in every row and every column each element is greater than the previous one (ai,j < ai + 1,j and ai,j < ai,j + 1). Given four ints - n, m, row and col - return a monotonous rectangular matrix with n rows and m columns which contains all integers between 0 and (n*m - 1) as elements, and the element (row, col) is as small as possible. All indices are 0-based. If there are several solutions, return the lexicographically smallest (see notes).  For example, if n = 4, m = 5, row = 3 and col = 3, the matrix is:</p>
<pre>
 0  1  2  3 16
 4  5  6  7 17
 8  9 10 11 18
12 13 14 15 19
</pre>
<p>Return the matrix as a String[] where the i-th element represents the i-th row. Each row should be represented as a single space separated list of the values within the row.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>The rectangular nxm matrix A is lexicographically smaller than the matrix B if and and only if the vector (A0,0, A0,1, ..., A0,m-1, A1,0, A1,1, ..., A1,m-1, ..., An-1,0, An-1,1, ..., An-1,m-1) is lexicographically smaller than the vector (B0,0, B0,1, ..., B0,m-1, B1,0, B1,1, ..., B1,m-1, ..., Bn-1,0, Bn-1,1, ..., Bn-1,m-1).</p>
