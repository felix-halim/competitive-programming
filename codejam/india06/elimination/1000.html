<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>You are given a set of two-dimensional vectors in two int[]s - x and y (the i-th elements of x and y represent x and y coordinates of the i-th vector). Find a subset of the vectors such that the sum of all vectors in the subset has the maximum possible length. Return this length.</p>

<h1>Definition</h1>
<pre>
Class:              VectorSet
Method:             maxLength
Parameters:         int[], int[]
Returns:            double
Method signature:   double maxLength(int[] x, int[] y)
(be sure your method is public)
</pre>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<ul>
<li>The sum of vectors (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is the vector (x1+x2, y1+y2).
<li>The length of vector (x, y) is the value sqrt(x * x + y * y).
<li>The returned value must be accurate to within a relative or absolute value of 1E-9.
<li>The input (as well as the resulting subset) can contain equal vectors (see example 1).
<li>Consider the entire set to be a subset.
</ul>

<h1>Constraints</h1>
<ul>
<li>x will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<li>x and y will contain the same number of elements.
<li>Each element of x will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.
<li>Each element of y will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.
</ul>
