<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

<p>A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. A rooted tree has one special vertex - the root (vertex 2 in the picture below).</p>

<img src="300.gif"><br>

<p>Vertex w is an ancestor of vertex v if w lies on the shortest path from the root to v. Vertex w is a parent of vertex v if it is an ancestor of v and is directly connected to v. For example, vertices 0, 2 and 4 are ancestors of vertex 0, and vertex 4 is a parent of vertex 0. The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of vertices v and w is the common ancestor of v and w which is located as far from the root as possible. For example, the LCA of vertices 1 and 3 is vertex 2, and the LCA of vertices 5 and 0 is vertex 4.</p>

<p>You will be given a String[] lca, with each element of lca being a space-separated list of integers. The i-th integer in the j-th element of lca represents the LCA of vertices i and j (all indices are 0-based). Using this information, you are to reconstruct the whole rooted tree. Find parents for all the vertices and return them in a int[]. The i-th element of the result must represent the parent of vertex i (use -1 for the parent of the root).</p>
