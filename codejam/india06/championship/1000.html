<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>String S is a SP-string if some non-empty prefix of S is also a suffix of S. The prefix (the suffix) can't be the whole string. For example, strings "AA" and "ABCABC" are SP-strings, but strings "AB", "ABCB" are not. String S is a N-string if it satisfies the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains only letters from the first N letters of the alphabet.
<li>If we append any single letter from the first N letters of the alphabet to S, the resulting string will be a SP-string.
</ul>
<p>For example, "ABBA" is a 2-string because it contains only the first 2 letters of the alphabet, and both "ABBAA" and "ABBAB" are SP-strings. There is an infinite number of N-strings, but in this problem we will consider only N-strings of minimal length (that is, N-strings of length L such that no N-string of length less than L exists).</p>
<p>You will be given two ints - N and K. Build all the shortest possible N-strings and sort them alphabetically. Return the substring of the K-th string from index leftIdx (inclusive) to index rightIdx (exclusive). Return "" if the K-th string contains less than rightIdx characters or the K-th string doesn't exist.</p>
