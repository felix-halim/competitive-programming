He talked about Google's computer architecture, the reliability of the Data Centers, the history of Google, etc...<br>
Google products such as Google Map, Google Earth, Robust API, Translation engine, and a list of expertise of Google.

Then we can have a dinner... I've to be honest that I eat less than 10% from the left picture.<br>
And the waiters were very kind, they offer more foods whenever possible. I've to say no all the time :P

We have a picture with <b>Annie Driscoll</b> (in white) and <b>Jeanne Williams</b> (in red).<br>
Without them this Google Code Jam 2006 wouldn't be a successful event!<br>
Jeanne, thanks for your help for my VISA and Ticket. I really appreciate it.
