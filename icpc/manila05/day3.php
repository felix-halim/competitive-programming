<p>
The practice session was too short and the ICPC committee was not prepare it well. The problem's input filename is different with the judge's input filename and that was not notified by the judges. Also the power went out once. The funny thing is, they do it again intentionaly. So the power went out twice. All computers restarted. Not long after that, the head of judge said: "The practice session ends in 2 minutes". Oh, what a useful practice. After he said that, we submit our solutions but they didn't judge it. The status of the submission is still "new" until the 2 minutes were over and we all leaved the practice room. Well... it's better than not having the practice session at all. At least we got to know that it's sufficient to use JCreator (we are not using Eclipse because it didn't work compatibly with JDK 1.5 and we didn't know how to set it up) and for the Dev C++ it went well.

Then we go to the basket ball court where they held the opening party.<br>
The Anggakusumas' (David and William) seemed very lucky that night. They got prizes over and over.<br>
We then head back to Richmonde Hotel and order fast food delivery, Jollibee!
