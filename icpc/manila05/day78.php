Although it's a good place, but it doesn't necessary means that it's easy to get the picture.

A scene where all of us jumped together.

The last restaurant that we ate in Kuala Lumpur before we go to the KLIA to went to Jakarta.<br>
This restaurant is just in the front of Corona inn.
</p>

<p>Before we went to KLIA, we have some photo transference to my laptop. That gave me more than enough material to write up this story. There are 7 different persons that bring along their cameras (Wilhan, Andoko, David, Susu, Wince, Yen Lina, Ing2), only Ing2 didn't do the transference for some reason. I had difficulties selecting photos from the abundance photos in my laptop to be included in this story... but that was payed off. This story is now completed :D Thanks to those who shared their pictures. Btw, If there's any intrusive words I made in my story, please notify me: felix.halim_at_gmail_dot_com</p>
