<h1>ACM ICPC Regional Manila 2005 - Summary</h1>

<p>IMHO, overall, this year ACM ICPC Regional Manila 2005 (held in Ateneo de Manila University) wasn't as good as the previous years (held in University of Asia and the Pacific). This year, they gave bags and t-shirt as souvenirs. The t-shirt quality seems to be improved from the last year but the scheduling and the contest preparations seems worse than last year. 

<p><b>Practice Session</b>. The waiting time between events were too long, the practice session were delayed and shortened (it became too short!) and was not pleasing since they didn't finish judging the runs in the queue when the practice session was over! Also the problem input name was renamed without notification! We kept getting wrong answer. Although it's a practice, it was still very dissapointing!</p>

<p><b>Contest Proper</b>. Several inconveniences arise during the contest proper:

<ol>

<li>
<u>Java Compile Error</u>, they promised that whatever compiled on our machine, will also be successfully compiled on the judge machine, but the fact says otherwise: many teams got penalties for compile error during the contest proper! and they didn't give clarification of why it happens. My team rewrites our Java solution (which get's compile error on Judge machine) to C/C++ solution because of that. The other teams also have the same experience. It's very disappointing. 

<li>
<u>Printing problems</u>, some teams have to use flashdisk to print!

<li>
<u>The standings</u>, the big projector which displays the teams' rank and their solved problem was MIS-LEADING! The problem name was out of order! For example, problem D is actually problem C on the standings! I think they really need to learn how to configure the PC2! (the online judge system for ICPC).. or.. were they jumble the problem name intentionaly? Anyway, whichever it is, it's unfair. 

<li>
<u>Controversial Problem</u>, there is this <a href="http://acm.ateneo.edu/problems/c.html">Problem C</a> in the problem set, which is controversial! A lot of clarifications were asked for that particular problem, seizing a lot of team's time! 

<li>
<u>Permission to the restroom</u>, We got a hard time to get to the restroom!

<li>
<u>Seating arrangements</u>, they wanted to make it similar to the world final seating arrangements where all teams compete in a single room. It's nice, but it makes the teams very uncomfortable since we didn't get enough space! They try to fit 98 teams in a not-so-big-theatre. We barely move and we barely put our paper on the table, we put some paper on the floor :o</p>

</ol>


<p><b>The awards</b>. Last year all of the team names were mentioned during the awards session (including the honorable mentions) and Top 10 teams were called to the podium. But this year, they only announced best 3 teams overall and best 3 local teams. It seems that they didn't give enough "appreciation" for all teams even for the top 10. It's ridiculous that team ranked 25 could receive award at the podium (because it's one of the best 3 local team) while the top 10 teams (overall) were not even mentioned!</p>

<p>The funny thing was that during the awards session, the local teams seems a lot happier than the "champion" (team name: Fate).</p>
