<h1>Day 6, Take off to Kuala Lumpur (31 Oct 2005)</h1>

<p>
Right after breakfast at 10 AM, we have to get packed, check out at 12 AM and went back to Kuala Lumpur 3 PM. We arrived at KLIA around 6 and went to Corona Inn, then seek for dinner. It's different from Manila, the night in Kuala Lumpur was bright as day. Many restaurants were open at night.

<p>At the Corona Inn, we played Alien Shooter, a very good game for releasing stress.</p>
