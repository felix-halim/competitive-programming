<h1>Day 1, Take off to Manila (4 Nov 2003)</h1>
<p>Early in the morning (3 AM) I checked my email for the last time before going to Manila just to say "I'm taking off". I packed my stuff and head straight to the airport. At the airport, we, BiNus Team assemble together (Felix Halim, Christian, Nicholas IS, Thompson SN -> Coach) and with their parents. The flight to Philiphine took 7-8 hours because we have to transit to Singapore. It was a tiring flight.

<p>At 2 PM, we met with 3 guides from University of Asia and the Pacific (UA&P). Two of them are girls (Sayine and Glyza) and one of them is a boy (Niko). The girls speak English fluently and both of them can drive a car, Wow.
<p>We were escorted by the girls to Richmonde Hotel by a car. I'm surprised that the girl, Glyza drive so easy in the middle of traffic. Hahaha... (I can't drive a car, only motorcycles). We all like the guides and become close to them.
<p>At night we were going to Mega Mall escorted by our loyal guides. The mall is similar to the mall in Jakarta (Indonesia). It kinda useless to buy souvernir here.
<p>After that, we head to McDonald and have dinner together (along with the guides). I love the Spaghetti. It's hard to find Spaghetti in Jakarta :(
