<h1>Analysis Problem B - Counting BST</h1>

<p>Problem summary: given a Binary Search Tree (BST) which shape depends on the given insertion order,
and the possible range of labels to use.
You are to count how many different insertion order (using the available labels) such that
the resulting shape BST is the same with the given BST.</p>

<p>This is a combinatoric problem:
among <b>M</b> possible labels, we want to choose <b>N</b> of them and use it to construct a BST.
Whatever <b>N</b> labels we pick, we can always form a BST.
Now we have pick <b>N</b> labels, the second problem is
to count how many BST insertion orders of the <b>N</b> labels 
that will produce the same shape as the given BST.
</p>

<p>The first problem is easily solved by computing <b>N</b> choose <b>K</b> using Dynamic Programming (again).
To answer the second problem, we need to imagine how we can insert a new node to a BST.
First the new node arrive at the root of the tree, we have a choice to insert a new node to the left
subtree or the right subtree. So, how many ways can we do this insertion?
Remember that the resulting subtree must match the shape of the given BST.
So, we can look at the given BST, how many child are there in the left subtree,
and the number of ways we can insert to the left is <b>nCk[S][L]</b>,
where <b>S</b> is the number of available labels to be inserted 
(which must be equal to the the number of nodes in the left + right subtree of the node)
and <b>L</b> is the number of nodes in the left subtree of the node.
The remaining <b>S - L</b> nodes must go to the right subtree.
Of course, this has to be applied recursively on the left and the right subtree.
See the function <b>f()</b> in the sample code below.
