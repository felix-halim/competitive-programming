<h1>Analysis Problem A - Worst Locations</h1>

<p>Problem summary: given a tree and two starting node Xa and Xb at two different leaf of the tree, and two distances Ya and Yb.
Find whether there exist a node <b>A</b> with distance exactly Ya steps away from Xa and another node <b>B</b>
with distance exactly Yb steps away from Xb such that distance between A and B is bigger than Z.</p>

<p>After some quick sketch, you will discover that there can be up to O(2^N) possible locations for <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.
Further analysis will discover the <b>pattern</b> of the locations of the nodes with "exactly Y distance away from leaf X".
Suppose you are exactly Y distance away from X and the tree height is N, the possible locations are:
Go up the tree <b>D</b> steps and from there, 
the possible locations are all the nodes in the other subtree (not the subtree where you go up from)
with height <b>Y-D</b> away.
Now, <b>D</b> can vary between <b>0</b> to <b>Y</b>, but not all <b>D</b> are valid since the distance has to be <b>exact</b>.
A distance <b>D</b> is <b>valid</b> if the height of the other subtree of the possible location is bigger or equal to the remaining distance <b>Y-D</b> (this will ensure the existance of such possible nodes).
</p>

<p>Since there is at most <b>N</b> possible values for <b>D</b>, we can do brute force on both pandas' starting nodes
and check for two possible pair of subtrees whether the there exists a node with distance > <b>Z</b>.
This check is easy: suppose you have two subtrees <b>Sa</b> and <b>Sb</b> and the possible locations are <b>Da</b> and <b>Db</b> steps away 
from the root of the subtree, respectively.
The subtree Sa and Sb have a least common ancestor <b>C</b>.
Then the maximum distance between a possible node in the subtree Sa with another possible node in the subtree Sb is
<b>Da + Db + distance(Sa's root, C) + distance(Sb's root, C)</b>,
where distance(x,y) is the distance between two node in the tree.
See sample code below.
