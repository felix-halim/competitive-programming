<p>We flight with Cathay Pacific, transit to Hong Kong for 3 hours before going to Kaohsiung - Taiwan. The food and movies were great, the flight was smooth. When we arrived in Taiwan, we were pick up by the ACM ICPC committees and went to the King Ship hotel with Taxi.</p>

We had some difficulties communicating with the receptionist at the hotel since she spoke too fast and only getting faster, in Chinese!<br>
In overall, the hotel is nice, the only problem is in our bathroom: the water flows very slow and many tiny cockroaches seen :(

The TV is great but I didn't understand a single word coming out from the speaker :P<br>
The best thing I like from this hotel is the unlimited-high-speed internet connection available for free!!
</p>

<p>The 7-eleven is just across the hotel, and the "Indomie instan" is so delicious! It has meat (not only seasoning)!</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the night finding files to be downloaded, queue it up, and then went to sleep :D (maklum, orang indo, blum ngerasain internet kenceng).</p>
