<h1>Problem H - Disconnected Graph</h1>
Time Limit: 10s
</center>

<p>Given an undirected connected simple graph of N nodes and E edges. There are up to Q nodes selected from N nodes that are special nodes. Suppose that R selected edges are destroyed, your task is to calculate how many pairs of node A-B where A and B belong to special nodes, are disconnected (there is no path from A to B or vice versa after R edges are destroyed).</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (1 &le; T &le; 50) the number of cases. Each case begins with four integers N, E, Q and R (1 &le; Q &le; N &le; 50,000; 0 &le; R &le; E &le; 200,000) denoting the number of nodes, edges, special nodes, and destroyed edges respectively. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. The next E line each contains two integers A<sub>i</sub> and B<sub>i</sub> (1 &le; A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub> &le; N) representing an edge connecting node A and node B. The next line contains Q integers P<sub>i</sub> (1 &le; P<sub>i</sub> &le; N) denoting the selected special nodes. The next line contains R integers T<sub>i</sub> (1 &le; T<sub>i</sub> &le; E) denoting the edges that are destroyed (the edges are numbered from 1 to E based on input order).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case, output in a single line a number denoting the number of disconnected pair of special nodes.</p>

<p><i>Explanation for the 1<sup>st</sup> sample input</i></p>
<img src="images/h.gif"/>
<p>There 5 pair of special nodes that are disconnected: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3 and 2-4.</p>

<p><i>Explanation for the 2<sup>nd</sup> sample input</i></p>
<p>There is only one special node, so we can't have any pair of them.</p>
