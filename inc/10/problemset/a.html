<h1>Problem A - The Best Team</h1>
Time Limit: 2s
</center>

<p>ACM-ICPC 2010 is drawing near and your university want to select three out of N students to form the best team. The university however, has a limited budget, so they can only afford to send one team. The coach wants his best team to be the best in term of compatibility. The compatibility of a team which member is student A, B and C is calculated by P<sub>A,B</sub> * P<sub>A,C</sub> * P<sub>B,C</sub>, where P<sub>i,j</sub> is the compatibility of student i and student j.</p>
<p>Given P<sub>i,j</sub> for all pair of students, calculate the highest compatibility value that can be achieved by any team of three students.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (1 &le; T &le; 100) the number of cases. Each case begins with an integer N (3 &le; N &le; 50) the number of students. The next N lines each contains N integers P<sub>i,j</sub> (0 &le; P<sub>i,j</sub> &le; 100). The i<sup>th</sup> line and j<sup>th</sup> integer denotes the compatibility of student i with student j. You may assume P<sub>i,j</sub> = P<sub>j,i</sub> and P<sub>i,i</sub> = 0.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output in a line the  highest compatibility value that can be achieved by any team of three students.</p>

<p><i>Explanation for the 1<sup>st</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>There are only three students so the coach has no choice but to select them.</p>

<p><i>Explanation for the 2<sup>nd</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>The best combination would be choosing student 1, 3 and 4.</p>
